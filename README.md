This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Peer
An offline-first dynamic Single-Page Application that uses the PWA approach. A RESTful API was also built (see the repo [here](https://github.com/siongesteban/peer-server)) to be consumed by the client app. It uses the Material UI (React [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) by mui-org) to give more app-like experience to the users when using with mobile.
